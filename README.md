EDF
===

Repository for storing and dealing with EDF files.

There already are two programs to convert these EDF files into the CSV and the ASCII formats: the `edf2csv` and the `edf2ascii` scripts. To convert from CSV to ASCII, use the `csv2single` and `csv2multiple` programs. `notes2csv` will take the annotations channel and format it into a CSV table.
